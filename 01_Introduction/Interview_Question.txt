1) What is React ??
React, often referred to as React.js or ReactJS, is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs). Its primary purpose is to enable developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications efficiently.

2) Library Vs Framework ??
A library is a collection of pre-written, reusable code for specific tasks, giving the developer control over the application's flow by calling the library's functions when needed. A framework, on the other hand, is a broader, pre-written structure and set of rules that dictates the application's architecture, controlling the flow by calling the developer's code at predefined points, which is known as inversion of control. 

Library
What it is: A set of tools, like a toolbox, containing pre-written code (functions, classes, etc.) for specific jobs. 
Control: The developer is in charge of the program's control flow, deciding when and how to use the library. 
Scope: Generally more specialized and focused on specific tasks. 
Example: jQuery, a JavaScript library that helps developers manipulate HTML and CSS. 
Framework
What it is: A pre-defined skeleton or structure for an application, providing a complete architecture that the developer builds their code into. 
Control: The framework controls the overall flow of the application and dictates when and where your code is called, a concept called "inversion of control". 
Scope: More comprehensive and provides a broader set of functionality and conventions for building the application. 
Example: Angular or Vue, JavaScript frameworks that provide a complete structure for building web applications. 



3) single page application vs multi page application
A Single Page Application (SPA) loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content with JavaScript, providing a smooth, app-like experience but requiring extra effort for SEO. A Multi-Page Application (MPA) loads a new page from the server with every user interaction, which is better for SEO, large content sites, and complex applications but can feel slower



4) What is SEO ??
Search Engine Optimization
SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of improving a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) to increase organic, unpaid traffic


5) Why Use React ??
Use React to build efficient, dynamic, and scalable user interfaces (UIs) due to its component-based architecture, virtual DOM for faster rendering, and large community support.
DRY -> Dont Repeat Yourself 


6) What Is Component Based Architechture ??


7) What are Package Managers ??

8) npm and npx ??


9) What is JSX ??
-> JAvascript XML. It has HTML Like structure
JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within their JavaScript files. It is primarily used with React to describe the structure and appearance of user interfaces.


10) Type of Components ??
Functiona Based and Class Based

11) JSX Feature ??

12) React Fragments ??
Using Two methods -> React.Fragments and <></>
